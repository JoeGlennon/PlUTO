					<td style="width: 500px;">The Bill Heitkamp Planetarium was founded in 1964. It was originally not part of the original construction plan of Loras's campus. It was built as a side project. 
					A crane meant to help construct the residence halls on the west side of campus was behind its deliver schedule.  Since the workers were being paid while the crane was 
					on its way, Loras officials used the materials at hand and its contract workers to construct the planetarium. Since its completion 50 years ago, the planetarium has served 
					the local community by providing presentations to the public as well as to private groups. Topics range from the explanation of mythological  stories that coincide with ancient 
					civilization's studies of the heavens above to the most complex topics in astrophysics.  All audiences are welcome!
